			<h3>Objective:</h3>
			<div class="aboutcontent">
			Embarking on the exciting adventure of changing careers.
			I came across the world of code one year ago and have been preparing to transition
			into this field since. I am leaving a lucrative salary and 10 years of healthcare experience to follow my passion with Prime Academy.

 			<h3>Summary: <small><i>who i am and what i do</i></small>	</h3>
			<div class="basics">

				<br><strong>Basics:</strong>
				<br>In 2008 I began my career as a Radiologic Technologist in Austin Tx.
					My strong <strong>work ethic, quick learning,  and positive attitude </strong>caught the attention of
					the Cardiac Cath lab manager and I was offered a position after only 6 months of
					healthcare experience. Typically, two years experience is mandatory.

					<br>Cardio Vascular/Interventional Technologist:
					 	<ul>
							<li> maintain sterility throughout preparation </li>
							<li> scrub in, assist the doctor during diagnostic and interventional procedures </li>
							<li> manage the multi-million dollar x-ray equipment </li>
							<li> prepare and handle all sterile equipment<li>
							<li> monitor and intrepret patients heart rate and rhythm</li>
							<li> monitor and intrepret blood pressure, oxygen, and respiratory rate</li>
							<li> respond to 30min response call-in for emergent procedures such as STEMI(heart attack)
						</ul>

<div class="clearfix">
</div>

					This career field is diverse, constantly changing and chaotic. Oftentimes I am working in a <strong>life or
					death situation</strong>. Everything is fast, so the expectation to know your job well imperative.
				 Throughout each procedure, <strong>multi-tasking</strong> and functional collaboration between the team members are essential
					elements for best possible outcome. <strong>Attention to detail</strong> is critical and could be the
					difference between life and death.  
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Travel:</strong>
					<br>In 2013 I decided that it was time to push my comfort level and embarked on my riskiest decision yet.
						My innate <strong>drive</strong> for learning and my <strong>passion</strong> for travel and new experiences
						lead me to pursue a career as a "travel" tech. For the past 4 years, I have traveled from hospital to hospital across the country to provide help for cath labs with staffing shortage.

			 <p>"Travelers" are required to be well experienced and to be able to <strong>adapt</strong> quickly to new environments. Hospitals need my help immediately and do not have time to train.
					Each lab is completely different. All doctors have their own way of doing things and it is my job to
					learn those differences, sometimes subtle differences, quickly. The basics are the same,
					but every lab is different. I am constantly learning and adapting to my new environment so that I can
					be helpful to the team in the way that they need. </p>
