			<h3>Objective:</h3>
			Embarking on the risky, intimidating, yet exciting adventure of changing careers.
			I came across the world of code one year ago and have been preparing to transition
			into this field since. I am leaving 10 years of healthcare experience to follow my passion.
		 </section>

 <section id="about">
			<h3>Summary: <small><i>who i am and what i do</i></small>	</h3>
				<br><strong>Basics:</strong>
				<br>In 2008 I began my career as a Radiologic Technologist in Austin Tx.
					My strong <strong>work ethic, quick learning,  and positive attidude </strong>caught the attention of
					the Cardiac Cath lab manager and I was offered a postiotion after only 6 months of
					health care experience. Typically, two years experience is mandatory. Radiologic
					programs provide very little training for a job in the Cardiac Cath/Interventional lab,
					therefore, all of my education for this position was on-the-job.

					<div id=tech>
						<img class=rightimage src="images/mescrub.jpg" height=200px width="150px">

					<p>Cardio Vascular/Interventional Technologist:
					 	<ul>
							<li> ARRT </li>
							<li> ACLS, BLS</li>
							<li> gather all appropriate equipment </li>
							<li> maintain sterility throughout preparation </li>
							<li> scrub in, and assist the doctor </li>
							<li> managing the multi-million dollar x-ray equipment </li>
							<li> monitor vitals</li>

						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix">
					</div>

					This career is both rewarding and stressful. Oftentimes I am working in a <strong>life or
					death situation</strong>. Everything is fast, so the expection to know your job well is high.
					There is very little time to "think" about it; the procedure must be completed
					<strong>efficiently</strong> and without the need to process each step. Throughout each procedure,
					<strong>multi-tasking</strong> and functional collaboration between the team members are essential
					elements for best possible outcome. <strong>Attention to detail</strong>is critical and could be the
					difference between life and death.   

	<strong>Travel:</strong>
					<br>In 2013 I decided that it was time to push my comfort level and embarked on my riskiest decion yet.
						My innate <strong>drive</strong> for learning and my extreme <strong>passion</strong> for travel and new experiences
						lead me to pursue a career a "travel" tech.
				<p>Because the learning curve for the cardiac cath lab is so high,
					it takes on average of 6mo-1year for on the job orientation to be complete.
					This leads to a shortage in staffing. In addition, labs are requried to have an on-call team at all times.
					In order to meet the staffing requirments, hospitals sometimes need to fill these positions with temporary
					employees untill staffing needs can be meet. This is what I have done for the past 4 years.
					 I travel from hospital to hospital across the country to feel the staffing needs for cath labs in need.
					 My contracts are typically 3-6months.</p>
			 <p>"Travelers" are required to be well experienced and to be able to <strong>adapt</strong> to new environments and
					to do that quickly. Hospitals need my help immedialtly and do not have time to train.
					Each lab is completley different. All doctors have their own way of doing things and it is my job to
					learn those differences, sometimes suttle differences, quickly. The basics are the same,
					but every lab is different. I am constantly learning and adapting to my new environment so that I can
					be helpful to the team in the way that they need. </p>
